const SATURN_CONTENT = `Saturn is one of the most beautiful planets in our solar system. It is the sixth planet from the Sun and is famous for its stunning rings that circle around it like a hula hoop!

Saturn is a giant planet made mostly of gas, just like Jupiter. It is so big that you could fit about 764 Earths inside it! Even though it's huge, Saturn is actually lighter than water. If you could find a bathtub big enough, Saturn would float!

The most amazing thing about Saturn is its rings. These rings are made of billions of pieces of ice and rock. Some pieces are as small as snowballs, while others are as big as houses! The rings stretch out for thousands of miles but are very thin.

Saturn has many moons - at least 83 of them! The biggest moon is called Titan, and it's even bigger than the planet Mercury. Titan has thick clouds and lakes, but instead of water, these lakes are filled with liquid methane.

Another interesting moon is Enceladus, which shoots giant water geysers into space from its south pole. Scientists think there might be an ocean under its icy surface where tiny sea creatures could live!

Saturn takes about 29 Earth years to travel around the Sun once. That means if you were born on Saturn, you would only have a birthday every 29 years! But Saturn spins very fast - one day on Saturn is only about 10 hours long.

The planet is named after the Roman god of farming and harvest. Ancient people could see Saturn in the night sky, but they couldn't see its rings without telescopes. When Galileo first looked at Saturn through his telescope in 1610, he thought the rings looked like handles!

Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium gases. The planet has strong winds that can blow at speeds of up to 1,100 miles per hour! These winds create beautiful bands of clouds in different colors - yellow, gold, and brown.`;

One of the most famous constellations is Andromeda, named after a princess in Greek mythology. Andromeda is best seen in the autumn sky in the Northern Hemisphere.

The constellation Andromeda contains the Andromeda Galaxy, which is the closest big galaxy to our own Milky Way galaxy. This galaxy is so far away that its light takes over 2 million years to reach us!

You can find Andromeda by first looking for the Great Square of Pegasus. Andromeda appears to be connected to this square through a bright star called Alpheratz.

The stars in Andromeda form a long, curved line that looks a bit like a person lying down. The brightest stars in this constellation are Alpheratz, Mirach, and Almach.

Ancient people told stories about Andromeda being chained to a rock by the sea as punishment. In the story, she was rescued by the hero Perseus, who is also a constellation nearby in the sky.

Constellations help us navigate and understand our place in the universe. They are like a map of the night sky that has been used by sailors, travelers, and astronomers for centuries.

The stars in a constellation may look close together from Earth, but they are actually very far apart from each other in space. They only appear to form patterns because of how we see them from our planet.`;
